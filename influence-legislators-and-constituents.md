It is also of great importance that the work is done proactively, continuously and flexibly. The amounts of data in real time as digitization generates makes it possible to understand and manage complicated and complex phenomenon. By building models for analysis and beslutsstödkan the positive impact that this new form of knowledge-building generates be used to support increased quality and efficiency in the public sector and the product and service in the business. To användadigit globalization opportunities need the public to create a legal infrastructure that supports these new opportunities. Technological development and usage patterns are intertwined and leads to many laws and regulations do not work in this new context, or that they act inhibiting development.

To enable a simple, secure and privacy-preserving information over the operational and organizational boundaries in the public sector need common rules. Several different laws involved in public sector activities depending on the contribution, exchange or other operational changes that will be implemented with the help of igitalisering. An example illustrating this is the introduction of the use of security technology for the elderly and disabled, where the business needs to take into account a number of laws such as the Constitution Act, the Health Care Act, the Social Services Act, the Privacy Act and CCTV teams. A major problem is that laws and regulations are developed before digitization and today's technology were making the formulations and concepts do not work for the area. This leads to substantial uncertainties in the interpretation of current legislation are hampering use of digitization opportunities in operations. Whether for security technology for the elderly and disabled, or any other activity digitized / technology formalized legislation is something that constantly need to be taken into account. There is a need to further clarify the legal conditions of municipal operations such as in the municipal health and social care. Methodological support around the interpretation of laws and regulations may be needed to support principals and accelerate the introduction of digitization activities.
