> # Ship
 
## Context
**Ship** (Software deployment) is all of the activities that make a software system available for use.

In continuous delivery, we introduce two new architectural attributes: testability and deployability.

In a testable architecture, we design our software such that most defects can (in principle, at least) be discovered by developers by running automated tests on their workstations. We shouldn’t need to depend on complex, integrated environments in order to do the majority of our acceptance and regression testing.

In a deployable architecture, deployments of a particular product or service can be performed independently and in a fully automated fashion, without the need for significant levels of orchestration. Deployable systems can typically be upgraded or reconfigured with zero or minimal downtime.
