## Context

> Common wisdom in software once held that architectural elements are "difficult to change later." An evolutionary architecture designs for incremental change in an architecture as a first principle. Evolutionary architectures are appealing because change has historically been difficult to anticipate and expensive to retrofit. If evolutionary change is built into the architecture, change becomes easier and cheaper, allowing changes to development practices, release practices, and overall agility.

## Motivation behind the choice
* The first architecture that designs for incremental change in an architecture as a first principle

## Alternatives that could have been chosen, but was not
* There are no real alternatives if the main objective is incremental, non-breaking change
